1. clearInterval: clearInterval() is used to stop a repeating interval that was set using setInterval().

2. We use clearInterval(countdown); at the start of startCountdown() to prevent multiple intervals from running simultaneously when the user clicks "Start" or "Resume" multiple times.

3. padStart(); The .padStart() method is used to add characters to the beginning of a string until it reaches a specified length.
        string.padStart(targetLength, padString);

4. outline: none;
